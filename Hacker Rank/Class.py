"""An object is simply a collection of data (variables) and methods (functions). Similarly, a class is a blueprint for that object.Before we learn about objects, let's first know about classes in Python.nA class is considered as a blueprint of objects. We can think of the class as a sketch (prototype) of a house. It contains all the details about the floors, doors, windows, etc. Based on these descriptions we build the house. House is the object. Since many houses can be made from the same description, we can create many objects from a class. The variables inside a class are called attributes."""


# Python gear bike class
# class bike:
#     name=""
#     gear=0

# Bike1=bike()

# Bike1.gear=11
# Bike1.name="Hero Honda"

# print(f"name of bike is {Bike1.name} and no. of gears is {Bike1.gear}")

#We can also create multiple objects from a single class. For example,
# class employee:
#     emp_id=0

# emp_id1=employee()
# emp_id2=employee()

# emp_id1.emp_id=123455
# emp_id2.emp_id=543217

# print(f"Employee id1 is {emp_id1.emp_id}\n Employee id2 is {emp_id2.emp_id}")


#We can also define a function inside a Python class. A Python Function defined inside a class is called a method.

#METHODS
