    <h1 style="text-align: center;">National Anthem </h1>
    <p>National Anthem refers to a musical composition that has been selected by an authorized government bodyand is meant to represent a country's patriotic ethos. It generally helps citizens relate to the country's spiritual and philosophical sentiments, its rich culture and colorful history. The national anthem presents a country's identity to the world and it acts as an instrument of unity among its citizens. 

        The National Anthem of India is entitled ‘Jana Gana Mana’. The song was originally composed in Bengali by India’s first Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore on December 11, 1911. The parent song, ‘Bharoto Bhagyo Bidhata’ is a Brahmo hymn which has five verses and only the first verse has been adopted as National Anthem. If put forwards succinctly, the National Anthem conveys the spirit of pluralism or in more popular term the concept of ‘Unity in Diversity’, which lies at the core of India’s cultural heritage. </p>
