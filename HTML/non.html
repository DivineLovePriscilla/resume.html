    <p>An example of this technique appears in the movie "12 Angry Men." <br>
        The sail training ship HMS Atalanta (originally named HMS Juno) disappeared with her entire crew after setting sail from the Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda for 
        Falmouth,England on 31 January 1880.[39] <br>It was presumed that she sank in a powerful storm which crossed her route a couple of weeks after she sailed, and
        that her crew being composed primarily of inexperienced trainees may have been a contributing factor.The search for evidence of her fate attracted worldwide 
        attention at the time (connection is also often made to the 1878 loss of the training ship HMS Eurydice,which foundered after departing the Royal Naval 
        Dockyard in Bermuda for Portsmouth on 6 March), and she was alleged decades later to have been a victim of the mysterious triangle, an allegation resoundingly 
        refuted by the research of author David Francis Raine in 1997.The incident resulting in the single largest loss of life in the history of the US Navy not 
        related to combat occurred when the collier Cyclops, carrying a full load of manganese ore and with one engine out of action, went missing without a trace with
        a crew of 309 sometime after March 4, 1918, after departing the island of Barbados.Although there is no strong evidence for any single theory, many independent
        theories exist, some blaming storms, some capsizing, and some suggesting that 
        wartime enemy activity was to blame for the loss.<br> In addition, two of Cyclops's sister ships, Proteus and Nereus, were subsequently lost in the North Atlantic
         during World War II. Both ships were transporting heavy loads of metallic ore similar to that which was loaded on Cyclops during her fatal voyage.
        In all three cases structural failure due to overloading with a much denser cargo than designed is considered the most likely cause of sinking. Carroll A. Deering, a five-masted schooner built in 1919, was found hard aground and abandoned at Diamond Shoals, near Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, on January 31, 1921. FBI investigation into the Deering scrutinized, then ruled out, multiple theories as to why and how the ship was abandoned, including piracy, domestic Communist sabotage and the involvement of rum-runners.Flight 19 was a training flight of five TBM Avenger torpedo bombers that disappeared on December 5, 1945, while over the Atlantic. The squadron's flight plan was scheduled to take them due east from Fort Lauderdale for 141 mi (227 km), north for 73 mi (117 km), and then back over a final 140-mile (230-kilometre) leg to complete the exercise. The flight never returned to base. The disappearance was attributed by Navy investigators to navigational error leading to the aircraft running out of fuel. One of the search and rescue aircraft deployed to look for them, a PBM Mariner with a 13-man crew, also disappeared. A tanker off the coast of Florida reported seeing an explosion[48] and observing a widespread oil slick when fruitlessly searching for survivors. The weather was becoming stormy by the end of the incident.
        According to contemporaneous sources the Mariner had a history of explosions due to vapour leaks when heavily loaded with fuel, as it might have been for a
         potentially long search-and-rescue operation.<br> Main articles: BSAA Star Tiger disappearance and BSAA Star Ariel disappearance G-AHNP Star Tiger disappeared on 
         January 30, 1948, on a flight from the Azores to Bermuda;
        sG-AGRE Star Ariel disappeared on January 17, 1949, on a flight from Bermuda to Kingston, Jamaica.<br> Both were Avro Tudor IV passenger aircraft operated by 
        British South American Airways.[50] Both planes were operating at the very limits of their range and the slightest error or fault in the equipment could keep them
         from reaching the small island.</p>
