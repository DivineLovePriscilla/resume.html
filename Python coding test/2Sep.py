#1. Count the number of vowels in a string using a for loop (where the string is taken as user input).

# a=input("Enter the string")
# count=0
# b=['a','e','i','o','u']
# for i in a:
#     if i in b:
#         count+=1
# print("Number of vowels in a given string is: ", count)

#2. Print all elements from a list that are divisible by 3 using a for loop (where the list is given).

# a=[12,2,3,25,81,19,6,7,4,5,]
# for i in a:
#     if i%3==0:
#         print(i)

#3. Print the Fibonacci sequence up to n terms using a while loop (where n is taken as user input).
n=int(input("Enter the number "))
f1=0
f2=1
